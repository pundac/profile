        At the end of my graduation, i can not help myself to observe an opposition between the customer demande tendency about sustainable packaging and some apposed offers on the market. But why does some companies does not comply with this increasing customer expectancy? They must have technical constrains and by consequence supply chain constrains? That is why i did my memoir about :WHAT ARE THE LIMITES OF SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN?"
